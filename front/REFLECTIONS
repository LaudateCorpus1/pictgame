premature optimisation - realised i was guilty of this when i refactored Canvas out into its own component. should have written template code for interfacing with the backend to see which variables i should assign to state and to whose state.

Negotiating a match between two peers with the same codebase s difficult. Decided instead to adopt leader election from raft and use it among the server instances to decide which'll matchmake.

21/1/2021:

Added rough code for raft's leader election, and a state machine impl for it after

Added prototype code for phi-accrual failure detection, but atm its useless since the election timeout interval [150,300) is larger than the expected heartbeat interval 50.
Need to find a way to keep checking if the failure is above the phi threshold, and the same time avoid infinite loops due to timing out too fast

Began writing the UI a few days ago. Really interesting to see how the need for react is minimised thanks to xstate. Most of the useEffects and useStates so far are for simple messages/timeouts
Perhaps ill write a svelte ui after this. Still need to optimise Canvas as it performs poorly on mobile

Just added an undo/redo feature for the drawing UI. Definitely my most favourite one so far, and the trickiest. Need to understand refs better
Changed Canvas to go from rerendering on every paint, to not rerendering, to rerendering on a completed brush stroke to facilitate the undo/redo feat.
